## Heart Failure Prediction
- A logistic Regression model using sklearn 
- Predicts whether the person's heart has failed or not using his/her clinical reports during the follow up period
### Description of the dataset:
| Feature                       |  Explanation                                    |
|:------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------|
| Age                           | Age of the patient                              | 
| Anaemia                       | Decrease of red blood cells or hemoglobin       | 
| High blood pressure           | If a patient has hypertension                   | 
| Creatinine phosphokinase (CPK)| Level of the CPK enzyme in the blood            | 
| Diabetes                      | If the patient has diabetes                     | 
| Ejection fraction             | Percentage of blood leaving                     | 
| Sex                           | Woman or man                                    | 
| Platelets                     | Platelets in the blood                          | 
| Serum creatinine              | Level of creatinine in the blood                | 
| Serum sodium                  | Level of sodium in the blood                    | 
| Smoking                       | If the patient smokes                           | 
| Time                          | Follow-up period                                | 
| DEATH_EVENT                   | If the patient died during the follow-up period |

### Conclusions of the Logistic Regression Model
- Contributions of the features:

##### Sex, smoking, platelets, high blood pressure, diabetes, creatinine phosphokinase and anaemia doesnt contribute much as compared to other Features to the model.
- Accuracy on train and test data:
